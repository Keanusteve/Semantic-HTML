# Semantic-HTML


Question 1).Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form? 
Answer: Symantic HTML allows us to things in a more specific way for the browser. Symantics matter to help SEO also be able to identify your page and content better. 
Div tags and other general HTML tags are less specific. This allows the browser to have affordance for how to better render not just the visual but also the none visible for those using screen readers. 


Question 2).What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML? 
it provides a better user experience as it informs the browser to a higher degree with elements in terms of role, name, state, and value if it has one. 


Question 3).What are some disadvantages? 
I cannot think of dissadvatages of symantic HTML I can however say that it requires additional time, in planning and coding, as well as perhaps testing a project. This may also require additional study times. 
I feel the advantages greatly outweight the disadvantages.
